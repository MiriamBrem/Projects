# The impact of age, empathy, screen usage, and sensation seeking on children’s cognition and social behavior


Planned and implemented an international training study on Scottish and Irish primary school children. This research examines the relationship between empathy and the everyday behaviors and development of children. In order to test this, 116 students from Scotland and Ireland between the ages of 5 to 13 were given an empathy questionnaire, a sensation seeking questionnaire, a cognitive abilities task, and a behavioral observation was performed.
